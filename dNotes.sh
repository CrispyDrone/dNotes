# Commands:
# dNotes FILENAME
# empties FILENAME, sends content to appropriate files, uses $TAG_FILES as the configuration file

# dNotes FILENAME -p
# preserves "bucket file", and sends content to appropriate files, uses $TAG_FILES as the configuration file

# dNotes FILENAME -c FILENAME1
# empties FILENAME, sends content to appropriate files, uses tags found in FILENAME1, sets FILENAME1 as environment variable $TAG_FILES

# dNotes man
# opens man page

# <@TAG>\r\nCONTENT\r\n</@TAG> will be the syntax for creating a block of content to send to a specific TAG, that is:
# <@TAG> followed by a newline, followed by the actual content, followed by a new line, followed by </@TAG>
# If this tag does not yet exist, an absolute path has to be added on a new line before the actual content like so: 

# <@TAG>
# C:\Users\Eigenaar\Projects\BWSort
# CONTENT
# </@TAG>

# The configuration file will be a JSON file, which is very easy to modify. There are tools to help with reading them in a command line, such as jq.

# what would be a good flow for the script? 
# I think first the configuration file need to be read ONCE, so you have all tags loaded into the script. 
# Then the program can start reading the "bucket file", one line at a time, but maybe not open the actual target file(s) just yet, but instead per used tag, keep track of all content that needs to be added, and do the write ONCE at the end
# If a tag that doesn't exist is encountered during the "bucket file" reading, add it to the in-memory dictionary, together with the file location
# After the bucket file is entirely read, write out all changes to the appropriate files (create if necessary)
# After writing out all content changes, (over)write the entire configuration file based on the new in memory one...
